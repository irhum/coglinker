Early experiments on science tooling

## Current State
A Jupyter notebook that allows you to do Q/A over any arXiv paper. Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/irhum/coglinker/blob/main/v0.ipynb).

## Open Questions
* How do we build tooling that helps people maximize their [transfer of learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_learning) when they read (and engage with) research?
